I modified the figure by replacing the square with a parametric heart shape, using its mathematical equation.\nI also customized the colors to fit my own style, going for a clean white outline on a black background and filling the rotated heart in red for contrast.\n\nheart &lt;- tibble(\n  t = seq(0, 2 * pi, length.out = 100),\n  x = 16 * sin(t)^3,\n  y = 13 * cos(t) - 5 * cos(2 * t) - 2 * cos(3 * t) - cos(4 * t)\n) \n\nrotated_heart &lt;- rotator(\n  data = heart,\n  x = x,\n  y = y,\n  angle = 180,\n  anchor = \"bottom\"\n)\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_path(\n    data = heart,\n    aes(x, y),\n    color = \"white\"\n  ) +\n  geom_polygon(\n    data = rotated_heart,\n    aes(x, y),\n    fill = \"red\"\n  ) +\n  coord_equal() +\n  theme_void() +\n  theme(\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"black\", color = NA),  \n    panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"black\", color = NA)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWave Based Patterns\nThis figure was inspired by this blog Â The Tidy Trekker, which explores using simple trigonometric functions to generate wave interference patterns.

I created it using polar coordinates in ggplot2 which I learned more about fromÂ this guide, where lines radiate out from the center in different directions. Each line has a random length to give it a more natural, uneven feel.
