# This is a repo for my personal website. This personal website is meant for the public to learn a little bit about me! 

The website includes the following pages:

- **Home (`index.qmd`)**: Introductory page with a short overview of who I am.
- **About (`about.qmd`)**: A more detailed summary of my background, interests, and goals.
- **Projects (`projects.qmd`)**: A collection of project highlights, including RStudio art and data visualizations.
- **Resume (`resume.qmd`)**: A digital version of my professional resume.
- **Drawing (`Drawing.qmd`)**: A creative section where I share personal artwork and digital illustrations.

The site uses a custom style defined in `styles.css` and is organized using clean, modular Quarto files.
