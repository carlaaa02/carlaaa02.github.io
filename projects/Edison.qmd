## Avian Functional Richness Spatial Distribution Research

**Role:** Research Intern, UCSB

**Program:** Edison STEM Summer Research Scholarship

**Scholarship amount:** \$5,000

**Description:**\
Conducted research on avian functional richness spatial distribution using provided datasets. Utilized R for data manipulation, statistical analysis, and visualization. Presented results at two research showcases.

**Key Activities:**

\- Cleaned and prepared avian trait and spatial distribution data

\- Computed functional richness metrics using `FD` and `tidyverse` packages

\- Generated spatial maps and statistical plots to visualize biodiversity pattern.
