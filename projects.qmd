## Avian Functional Richness Spatial Distribution Research

**Role:** Research Intern, UCSB\
**Program:** Edison STEM Summer Research Scholarship

**Description:**\
Conducted research on avian functional richness spatial distribution using provided datasets. Utilized R for data manipulation, statistical analysis, and visualization. Presented results at two research showcases.

**Key Activities:** - Cleaned and prepared avian trait and spatial distribution data - Computed functional richness metrics using `FD` and `tidyverse` packages - Generated spatial maps and statistical plots to visualize biodiversity pattern.

## Tropical Field Research and Data Analysis in Panama

**Role:** Participant, UCSB & *Col√≥n, Panama*\
**Program:** Smithsonian Scholars Program

**Description:**\
Participated in an advanced field research course focused on tropical ecology and data analysis. The program included intensive training in R programming for field-based data analysis, hands-on use of bioacoustic and camera trap technologies, and field assessments of tropical bird populations.

**Key Activities:** - Completed a focused R programming course for analyzing ecological field data - Deployed AudioMoth devices and camera traps to collect environmental data - Conducted point counts for avian population assessments in tropical forests

**Skills Gained:** - Environmental data collection techniques - Field survey methodology for avifauna - Applied ecological statistics in R

**Reflection:**\
This immersive program strengthened my ability to collect and analyze field data in real-world tropical ecosystems, bridging practical field methods with analytical tools.
