### Welcome to my site!

My name is Carla Quintanilla, and Iâ€™m currently a fourth-year student at the University of California, Santa Barbara. I have a strong passion for the outdoors and enjoy spending time in nature. My academic interests focus on groundwater management, and after graduation, I plan to continue working as an Assistant Manager at Panda Express while beginning graduate school.
