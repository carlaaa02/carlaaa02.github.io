## Paper Sketches

![Deer Geometry](photos/deer.jpg)

This was one of my first drawings! I wanted to experiment with geometry patterns and came up with this.

I love dinosaurs! This a very simple but cool drawing and the first dinosaur I draw.

## Digital Skeches

![Nature](photos/nature.jpg)

This drawing was inspired by my trip to Panama. I started it on the plane and completed it over the two weeks I spent there. It represents the connection between nature and humanity.

![Brachiosaurus](photos/dino_dig.jpg)

Long-necked dinosaurs are my favorite! they look so adorable in most sketches. That’s why I wanted to try something different by drawing a slightly scarier, more realistic version

------------------------------------------------------------------------

![Museum Art](photos/museum.jpg)

This drawing was inspired by famous museum artworks, with the background featuring the UCSB library. I created it while sitting in the library’s egg-shaped chairs. I left the background blank because I liked the contrast it created with the art pieces. This is also one of the few times I added color to my work, as I usually prefer pencil drawing styles. I plan to add more detail to it in the future.

![Woman](photos/personal.jpg)

This was my first digital sketch, created using the Procreate app on my iPad. I wanted to design a drawing that could serve as a template for my first tattoo. I haven’t gotten the tattoo yet but hopefully soon!
